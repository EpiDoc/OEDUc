* you need exsit-db latest release to use this app.
* the code contained, XQUERY, XSLT, JS, CSS, can be reused instead and is itself largely reused from other sources, like the EpiDoc example XSLT, some functions of the exist-db demo apps, etc.
* many links might have to be fixed as they have to be absolute due to my local proxy settings only. this is a copy of what is actually running at http://betamasaheft.aai.uni-hamburg.de:8080/exist/apps/OEDUc/index.html
* packaged .xar app is available with the EDH data, but could not be uploaded

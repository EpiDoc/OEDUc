# OEDUc
## Open Epigraphic Data Unconference

Starting with a one-day workshop, or “unconference,” held at the Institute of Classical Studies, University of London on May 15, 2017, the **OEDUc** activities ([programme and notes here](https://github.com/EpiDoc/OEDUc/wiki)) bring together scholars, historians and data scientists with a shared interest in classical epigraphic data. The event involved no speakers or set programme of presentations, but rather a loose agenda, to be further refined in advance or on the day, which was to use, exploit, transform and “mash-up” with other sources the Open Data recently made available by the [Epigraphic Database Heidelberg](http://edh-www.adw.uni-heidelberg.de/data/export) under a Creative Commons license. Participants with programming and data-processing experience, and those with an interest in discussing and planning data manipulation at a higher level, are equally welcome.
